## Development
Using [cargo-watch], you can recompile Rust on file changes. Install it using `cargo install cargo-watch`. Also install the [Node.js] dependencies with [Yarn] by running `yarn install`.

Compiling server, styles, and admin, and recompiling each of them on changes, is done with
```bash
yarn watch
```
